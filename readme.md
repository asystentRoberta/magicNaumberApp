## Magic numbers

----

### Console application. 

The application checks the correctness of the file extension. 
At the moment it supports:
* txt files
* jpg files 
* gif files 

If you want to use the application, follow these steps:

```batch
git clone https://github.com/asystentRoberta/magicNumberApp
cd magicNumberApp
./build gradle

cd build/libs
```
and then execute:
```batch
java -jar magicNumberApp-0.1.jar fileToTest
```
where  _**fileToTest**_  is the file you want to test (file has to be in _/build/libs/_  folder) or path to file (for
 example _/home/user/text.txt_  or _C:\Users\\%USERNAME%\Documents\text.txt_)
